# Qiskit API Introduction 

This work aims to explain the Qiskit API in a simpler and more understandable manner. By addressing fundamental concepts clearly, it enables users to easily step into the world of quantum computer programming. Supported by examples and step-by-step instructions, this work helps users effectively understand the power and usage of Qiskit.

# Contents 

The work within the repository will be examined under eight main headings. These are:
**1. Circuit Construction,**

**2. Quantum Information,**

**3. Transpilation,**

**4. Primitives and Providers,**

**5. Results and visualizations,**

**6. Serialization,**

**7. Pulse-level programming,**

**8. Other**

These sections are also officially divided in the published Qiskit. Therefore, they will be used in this work accordingly.
