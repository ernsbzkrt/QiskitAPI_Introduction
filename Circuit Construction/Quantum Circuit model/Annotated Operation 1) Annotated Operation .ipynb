    "#### **1.2. Annotated Operation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a definition here. An Annotated Operation is a type of operation used in quantum circuits. To elaborate a bit more, it takes a basic operation and adds various modifiers to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed before, it is worth reminding that in quantum computing, basic operations are usually known as quantum gates. However, gates are not the only basic operations. Basic operations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quantum Gates,\n",
    "- Measurement Operations,\n",
    "- State Preparation,\n",
    "- Phase Gates,\n",
    "- Composite Operations (QFT, Grover Diffusion Operator),\n",
    "- Modifiers,\n",
    "- Entanglement Operations (Bell, GHZ state)\n",
    "\n",
    "We mentioned above that this operator adds various modifiers. Currently, the supported modifiers in the latest version are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **InverseModifier**: Takes the inverse of the basic operation.\n",
    "* **ControlModifier**: Adds control to the basic operation, for example, controlled gates.\n",
    "* **PowerModifier**: Takes a power of the basic operation, for example, applying the gate a specific number of times."

    "* **1. High-Level Abstraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "High-Level Abstraction is the process of breaking down complex systems into simpler and more understandable parts. This allows users to focus on the overall functionality and logic without delving into the system's details. In quantum computing, abstraction makes it easier to understand and manage quantum circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract Representation expresses an operation or system in general terms without providing all the details. This enables users or developers to understand the overall functionality and logic of the system without dealing with the underlying details.\n",

    "* Ease of Use and Understandability,\n",
    "* Error Reduction,\n",
    "* Optimization.\n",
