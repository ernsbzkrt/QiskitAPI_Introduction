# Circuit Construction

In this section, we will discuss Circuit Construction in the Qiskit API, focusing on making the creation and management of quantum circuits more understandable and straightforward. We aim to provide a fresh perspective to readers by addressing aspects not covered in the API documentation. Our goal is to enhance the comprehensibility of the provided API and make Qiskit, the popular library for Quantum Computing, more accessible and easier to use.

# Context 

In this work, we will examine the following sections in order:

**1. Quantum circuit model (qiskit.circuit)**

**2. QuantumCircuit class**

**3. Classical expressions (qiskit.circuit.classical)**

**4. ClassicalFunction compiler (qiskit.circuit.classicalfunction)**

**5. Circuit Library (qiskit.circuit.library)**

**6. Singleton instructions (qiskit.circuit.singleton)**
